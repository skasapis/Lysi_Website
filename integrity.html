                <h3>So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.</h3>
                <h3>It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.</h3>

                <h3>The decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also resurrected Cicero—or at least what used to be Cicero—in an attempt to make the days before computerized design a little less painstaking.</h3>
                <h3>The French lettering company Letraset manufactured a set of dry-transfer sheets which included the lorem ipsum filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and layouts. These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use.</h3>
                <h3>Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, ushered lorem ipsum into the information age with its desktop publishing software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem ipsum dummy text for laying out page content, and other word processors like Microsoft Word followed suit. More recently the growth of web design has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the internet as a placeholder for future text—and in some cases the final content (this is why we proofread, kids).</h3>

                <h2>LSA Community Standards of Academic Integrity</h2>
                <h3>The LSA undergraduate academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. The College holds all members of its community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the College promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates the academic integrity and ethical standards of the College community cannot be tolerated. The College seeks vigorously to achieve compliance with its community standards of academic integrity. Violations of the standards will not be tolerated and will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action.</h3>
                <h2>The Office of the Assistant Dean</h2>
                <h3>Among the primary responsibilities of the Office of the Assistant Dean (Student Academic Affairs) is leadership of the LSA Academic Judiciary Committee and oversight of the academic judiciary processes in the College. The Assistant Dean is responsible for ensuring that a fair and judicious process exists for adjudicating cases of academic misconduct when the LSA Community Standards of Academic Integrity may have been violated. The Office of the Assistant Dean works to promote and maintain a high degree of academic integrity in the College.</h3>

                <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
                <h3>Plagiarism is representing someone else’s ideas, words, statements, or other work as one’s own without proper acknowledgement or citation. Examples of plagiarism include:</h3>

                    <li>Paraphrasing, that is, using another person’s written words or ideas, albeit in one’s own words, as if they were one’s own thought.</li>
                    <li>Borrowing facts, statistics, graphs, or other illustrative material without proper reference, unless the information is common knowledge, in common public use.</li>
                    <li>Submitting substantially the same paper for two or more classes (or the same class) in the same or different terms (i.e., self-plagiarism) without the expressed approval of each instructor.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Unacceptable Collaboration</h2>
                <h3>Collaboration is unacceptable when a student works with another or others on a project and then submits written work which is represented explicitly or implicitly as the student’s own individual work. Examples of unacceptable collaboration include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using answers, solutions, or ideas that are the result of collaboration without citing the fact of collaboration.</li>

                </ul>
                <h2>Aiding and Abetting Dishonesty</h2>

                <h3>Unauthorized or malicious interference or tampering with faculty, administrative, or staff offices, including computers, is considered an academic offense and, as such, is subject to College judicial procedures and sanctions.</h3>
                <h2>Classroom Disturbances</h2>
                <h3>Classroom disturbances can also serve to create an unfair academic advantage for oneself or disadvantage for another member of the academic community. Some examples of actions that may violate the LSA Community Standards of Academic Integrity include:</h3>
